# Arma 3 Basic Mission Template (A3-BMT)

**Author**: TheMagnetar.

**Version**: 1.0.

**Last modified**: 2016/04/06.

**Description**: The "Arma 3 Basic Mission Template" (A3-BMT) was designed in order to ease the amount of
work required when editing a mission for Arma 3. Although originally envisaged to satisfy the needs of the
"1er Regiment Aerotransportat (1RA)" of the Catalan community of simulation "Cavallers del Cel", its scope
has broaden since its adoption by other communities.

## Requirements:

The "Arma 3 Basic Mission Template (A3-BMT) has been designed to be flexible and to be independent from
external addons. Any contributer that wants to add an external script must include it with an option to
deactivate it.

## Structure:

The template has the following folder structure:

* "\" (root foler): This folder contains those files that are essential for the mission and the template: description.ext, init.sqf, mission.sqm, bmt_components.hpp and this README file.
* "\DAC": This folder contains the configuration files for the addon Dynamic-AI-Creator. The mission creator does not need to place External DAC Logic since this is handled automatically by the template. This tool, created by Silola, allow generating AI quickly and dynamically and it allows to save some resources through AI caching techniques. More information can be found in http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?176926-DAC-V3-1-(Dynamic-AI-Creator)-released.
* "\externalScripts": This folder contains third party addons and scripts.
  * "\externalScripts\T8": The `T8 Units` script by T-800a. This is a less dynamic AI creator that is compatible with DAC. More information can be found in https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/172795-release-t8-units-a-less-dynamic-ai-creator/.
* "\images": Folder where all images are stored.
* "\missionConfig": Folder where scripts and functions, organised in subfolders, that need to be modified for every mission are stored. It contains:
  * "\missionConfig\ace3": Scripts and functions to configure ACE3.
  * "\missionConfig\acre2": Scripts and functions to configure ACRE2.
  * "\missionConfig\briefing": Scripts to generate the briefings for each of the supported factions. Server administrator has a especial briefing.
  * "\missionConfig\configEquipment": Scripts and functions to equip the unit for each of the supported factions. They can be used for vehicles, infantry and ammo boxes.
  * "\missionConfig\core": Scripts and functions that define core variables and/or check the configuration of loaded addons.
  * "\missionConfig\endMission": Functions that allow ending the mission once certain conditions are met.
  * "\missionConfig\intro": Scripts for mission introduction screens. Each of the supported factions has an own introduction.
  * "\missionConfig\t8units": Scripts to configure the `T8 Units` unit generation script by T-800a. More information can be found in https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/172795-release-t8-units-a-less-dynamic-ai-creator/.
